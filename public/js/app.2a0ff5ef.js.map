The plugin is a data processor and can thus be used\r\n in combination with standard line / point rendering options.\r\n\r\n => 1) with large data sets you may get trouble\r\n => 2) if you want to display the points too, you have to plot them as 2nd data series over the lines\r\n => 3) consecutive x data points are not allowed to have the same value\r\n\r\n Feel free to further improve the code\r\n\r\n ____________________________________________________\r\n\r\n how to use it:\r\n ____________________________________________________\r\n\r\n var d1 = [[5,5],[7,3],[9,12]];\r\n\r\n var options = { series: { curvedLines: {  active: true }}};\r\n\r\n $.plot($(\"#placeholder\"), [{data: d1, lines: { show: true}, curvedLines: {apply: true}}], options);\r\n\r\n _____________________________________________________\r\n\r\n options:\r\n _____________________________________________________\r\n\r\n active:           bool true => plugin can be used\r\n apply:            bool true => series will be drawn as curved line\r\n monotonicFit:\t   bool true => uses monotone cubic interpolation (preserve monotonicity)\r\n tension:          int          defines the tension parameter of the hermite spline interpolation (no effect if monotonicFit is set)\r\n nrSplinePoints:   int \t\t\tdefines the number of sample points (of the spline) in between two consecutive points\r\n\r\n deprecated options from flot prior to 1.0.0:\r\n ------------------------------------------------\r\n legacyOverride\t   bool true => use old default\r\n    OR\r\n legacyOverride    optionArray\r\n {\r\n \tfit: \t             bool true => forces the max,mins of the curve to be on the datapoints\r\n \tcurvePointFactor\t int  \t\t  defines how many \"virtual\" points are used per \"real\" data point to\r\n \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  emulate the curvedLines (points total = real points * curvePointFactor)\r\n \tfitPointDist: \t     int  \t\t  defines the x axis distance of the additional two points that are used\r\n }\t\t\t\t\t\t   \t\t   \t  to enforce the min max condition.\r\n */\r\n\r\n/*\r\n *  v0.1   initial commit\r\n *  v0.15  negative values should work now (outcommented a negative -> 0 hook hope it does no harm)\r\n *  v0.2   added fill option (thanks to monemihir) and multi axis support (thanks to soewono effendi)\r\n *  v0.3   improved saddle handling and added basic handling of Dates\r\n *  v0.4   rewritten fill option (thomas ritou) mostly from original flot code (now fill between points rather than to graph bottom), corrected fill Opacity bug\r\n *  v0.5   rewritten instead of implementing a own draw function CurvedLines is now based on the processDatapoints flot hook (credits go to thomas ritou).\r\n * \t\t   This change breakes existing code however CurvedLines are now just many tiny straight lines to flot and therefore all flot lines options (like gradient fill,\r\n * \t       shadow) are now supported out of the box\r\n *  v0.6   flot 0.8 compatibility and some bug fixes\r\n *  v0.6.x changed versioning schema\r\n *\r\n *  v1.0.0 API Break marked existing implementation/options as deprecated\r\n *  v1.1.0 added the new

Negative numbers don't make sense for a\r\npie chart, and have unpredictable results.  The values do NOT need to be\r\npassed in as percentages; the plugin will calculate the total and per-slice\r\npercentages internally.\r\n\r\n* Created by Brian Medendorp\r\n\r\n* Updated with contributions from btburnett3, Anthony Aragues and Xavi Ivars\r\n\r\nThe plugin supports these options:\r\n\r\n\tseries: {\r\n\t\tpie: {\r\n\t\t\tshow: true/false\r\n\t\t\tradius: 0-1 for percentage of fullsize, or a specified pixel length, or 'auto'\r\n\t\t\tinnerRadius: 0-1 for percentage of fullsize or a specified pixel length, for creating a donut effect\r\n\t\t\tstartAngle: 0-2 factor of PI used for starting angle (in radians) i.e 3/2 starts at the top, 0 and 2 have the same result\r\n\t\t\ttilt: 0-1 for percentage to tilt the pie, where 1 is no tilt, and 0 is completely flat (nothing will show)\r\n\t\t\toffset: {\r\n\t\t\t\ttop: integer value to move the pie up or down\r\n\t\t\t\tleft: integer value to move the pie left or right, or 'auto'\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\tstroke: {\r\n\t\t\t\tcolor: any hexidecimal color value (other formats may or may not work, so best to stick with something like '#FFF')\r\n\t\t\t\twidth: integer pixel width of the stroke\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\tlabel: {\r\n\t\t\t\tshow: true/false, or 'auto'\r\n\t\t\t\tformatter:  a user-defined function that modifies the text/style of the label text\r\n\t\t\t\tradius: 0-1 for percentage of fullsize, or a specified pixel length\r\n\t\t\t\tbackground: {\r\n\t\t\t\t\tcolor: any hexidecimal color value (other formats may or may not work, so best to stick with something like '#000')\r\n\t\t\t\t\topacity: 0-1\r\n\t\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\t\tthreshold: 0-1 for the percentage value at which to hide labels (if they're too small)\r\n\t\t\t},\r\n\t\t\tcombine: {\r\n\t\t\t\tthreshold: 0-1 for the percentage value at which to combine slices (if they're too small)\r\n\t\t\t\tcolor: any hexidecimal color value (other formats may or may not work, so best to stick with something like

Flot plugin for plotting textual data or categories.\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2007-2014 IOLA and Ole Laursen.\r\nLicensed under the MIT license.\r\n\r\nConsider a dataset like [[\"February\", 34], [\"March\", 20], ...]. This plugin\r\nallows you to plot such a dataset directly.\r\n\r\nTo enable it, you must specify mode: \"categories\" on the axis with the textual\r\nlabels, e.g.\r\n\r\n\t$.plot(\"#placeholder\", data, { xaxis: { mode: \"categories\" } });\r\n\r\nBy default, the labels are ordered as they are met in the data series. If you\r\nneed a different ordering, you can specify \"categories\" on the axis options\r\nand list the categories there:\r\n\r\n\txaxis: {\r\n\t\tmode: \"categories\",\r\n\t\tcategories: [\"February\", \"March\", \"April\"]\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nIf you need to customize the distances between the categories, you can specify\r\n\"categories\" as an object mapping labels to values\r\n\r\n\txaxis: {\r\n\t\tmode: \"categories\",\r\n\t\tcategories: { \"February\": 1, \"March\": 3, \"April\": 4 }\r\n\t}\r\n\r\nIf you don't specify all categories, the remaining categories will be numbered\r\nfrom the max value plus 1 (with a spacing of 1 between each).\r\n\r\nInternally, the plugin works by transforming the input data through an auto-\r\ngenerated mapping where the first category becomes 0, the second 1, etc.\r\nHence, a point like [\"February\", 34] becomes [0, 34] internally in Flot (this\r\nis visible in hover and click events that return numbers rather than the\r\ncategory labels). The plugin also overrides the tick generator to spit out the\r\ncategories as ticks instead of the values.\r\n\r\nIf you need to map a value back to its label, the mapping is always accessible\r\nas \"categories\" on the axis object, e.g. plot.getAxes().xaxis.categories.\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n(function ($) {\r\n    var options = {\r\n        xaxis: {\r\n            categories: null\r\n        },\r\n
